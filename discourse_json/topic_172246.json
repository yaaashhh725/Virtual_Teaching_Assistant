I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?<br>\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?</p>\n<p>Thank you and Regards<br>\nAkshit</p>",

Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.</p>\n<p>Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.</p>\n<p>We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to your kind consideration.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nDigvijaysinh Chudasama</p>",

However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.</p>\n<p>Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.</p>\n<p>We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to your kind consideration.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nHARSH JAYSWAL</p>",

Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.</p>\n<p>Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.</p>\n<p>I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\">@carlton</a></strong>, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.</p>",

There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7.</p>\n<p>Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment.</p>\n<p>We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nPalaash V. Upadhyay</p>",

We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.</p>",

I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.</p>\n<p>However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.</p>\n<p>Addressing the queries you raised in your post:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Learner,<br>\nDEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm<br>\nGA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission.<br>\nPlease find the form link below to submit your evaluations.<br>\n<a href=\"https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9</a><br>\nAFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email,<br>\nif you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.<br>\nYou will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer).

I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and <strong>my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.</strong> <strong>They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE</strong> release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.</p>\n<p>I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.</p>\n<p>Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.</p>\n<p>To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.</p>\n<p>Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.</p>\n<p>I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.<br>\nThank you once again for your understanding.</p>",

Here is the main query that most people are having:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote group-ds-students\" data-username=\"23f2004636\" data-post=\"29\" data-topic=\"172246\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2004636/48/86136_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> 23f2004636:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:</p>\n<p>Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement.</p>\n<p>The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other.</p>\n<p>192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this</p>\n<p>As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least).</p>\n<p>When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?</p>\n<p>It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort <strong>before</strong> there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.</p>\n<p>Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.</p>\n<p>The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie.</p>\n<p>I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th># Assignments Done</th>\n<th># students</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>42</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>33</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>28</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Assignment_Score</th>\n<th># students</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0-10</td>\n<td>75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11-20</td>\n<td>19</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21-30</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>31-40</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>41-50</td>\n<td>13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>51-60</td>\n<td>7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>61-70</td>\n<td>11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>71-80</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>81-90</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>91-100</td>\n<td>17</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>",

I just have one sincere doubt:</p>\n<p>As you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs—but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the <strong>total course marks</strong>, instead of awarding <strong>15/100 of the total</strong> to those who did GA7 exceptionally well?</p>\n<p>Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too?</p>\n<p>It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs.</p>\n<p>I’m only concerned about <strong>my own marks</strong>, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and understanding.<br>\n<a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/carlton\">@carlton</a> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/jivraj\">@Jivraj</a></p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Thanks for the clarification. I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair.</p>\n<p>However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so <em>not</em> for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.</p>\n<p>Now that bonus marks are announced <em>after</em> the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement.</p>\n<p>I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.</p>",

        "cooked": "<p>Sir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course.</p>\n<p>If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4.</p>\n<p>The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score.</p>\n<p>Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they <strong>attended</strong> GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair.</p>\n<p>Please think from our side.</p>\n<p>Regards<br>\nKarthik</p>",

Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading.</p>\n<p>For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.</p>\n<p>Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these</p>",

It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system.

I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter.</p>\n<p>Further, you mentioned:</p>\n<aside class=\"quote group-ds-students\" data-username=\"jkmadathil\" data-post=\"34\" data-topic=\"172246\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/jkmadathil/48/100121_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> jkmadathil:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>I completely respect the effort put in by those students.<br>\nHowever, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication.</p>\n<p>If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort <em>specific to GA7</em>, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the <strong>GA7 score</strong> only, not in the <strong>overall course total</strong>, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term.</p>\n<p>I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning.</p>\n<p>Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.</p>",

So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility.</p>\n<p>Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations.</p>\n<p>Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.</p>\n<p>Thank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view.</p>",

This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks.</p>\n<p>Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7).  We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship.</p>\n<p>How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment.</p>\n<p>Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.</p>\n<p>Regards<br>\nKarthik</p>",

Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.</p>\n<p>Firstly students <em>vastly</em> overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.</p>\n<p>So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.<br>\nOnly 2 students managed it.</p>\n<p>Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 <em>might</em> have even managed to get 3 or more marks.</p>\n<p><em>So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.</em> The mean bonus score was 1.27.</p>\n<p>So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.</p>\n<p>That is the data for you.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/1/017f0ec92b42bfae7104a70faba6d9d7ebb64ed4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/deHf28Oaap6ghcEFhqiZc4fCrG.png?dl=1\" title=\"Student Bonus\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/0/1/017f0ec92b42bfae7104a70faba6d9d7ebb64ed4.png\" alt=\"Student Bonus\" data-base62-sha1=\"deHf28Oaap6ghcEFhqiZc4fCrG\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">Student Bonus</span><span class=\"informations\">600×371 7.62 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-619094-also-noteworthy-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-619094-also-noteworthy-1\"></a>Also noteworthy</h3>\n<p>Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.</p>\n<p>None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?</p>\n<p>Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are <em>not</em> widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!</p>\n<p><strong>Bonuses are not a right.</strong> They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.</p>\n<p>However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.</p>\n</blockquote>",

While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators.</p>\n<p>Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted<br>\nSir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.</p>",

The  course’s rules  seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : )<br>\nPlease correct me if I am wrong</p>",
