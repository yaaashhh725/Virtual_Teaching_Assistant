# which-subject-to-choose-in-jan-term

Hii all…i know this may not be the correct platform to ask this question.  
Actually i have 3 diploma subjects to cover - MLP, JAVA, TDS. So which 2 subject should i choose for this term?

---

Don’t take TDS, this subject should be taken in the end else you might have some problem

TDS at the end best. Gives you the best chance of doing well in it.

Kind regards

Yes you should do tds after mlp only it really help you alot trust me

---

You should focus on TDS at latter stage of your diploma
