# contribute-to-my-open-source-llm-classroom-assignment-evaluator

Dear all,

I’m thrilled to share a project inspired by my experience in the \*Tools in Data Science \* course: [**LLM Classroom Assignment Evaluator**](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom). This is the basic prototype.

This tool leverages Google APIs and LLMs to automate grading and feedback for Google Classroom assignments, making evaluation faster and more insightful for educators.

A heartfelt thanks to **[@s.anand](/u/s.anand)**, our course instructor, and TAs **[@Carlton](/u/carlton)** and **[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)**, whose guidance on LLM function calling and real-world applications made this project possible.

I’d love to invite contributions from this amazing community to:

* Expand functionality and evaluation models.
* Fix bugs and optimize workflows.
* Improve documentation for broader accessibility.

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AvinashShrivastav/LLM_Assignment_Evaluator_GoogleClassroom) is open for forks, pull requests, and ideas. I look forward to collaborating with you all!

Update: here is a video explaining the process - <https://youtu.be/xa4zhP-S3NE?feature=shared>  
Best regards,

Hi Avinash,

Thats great work! I am glad you were able to use what you learnt from the course for something so practical. I hope you continue to develop and refine it, take feedback from the stakeholders who would be interested in this approach. I see a lot of potential in this project.

Kind regards
