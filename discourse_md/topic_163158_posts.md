Same issue with me sir.  
This is how my dashboard looks like. It shows the same for week 2 as well.

image description: The image is a screenshot of a webpage, possibly related to an online course. On the left side, there's a navigation menu showing "Modules" and "Grades." Under "Modules," there's an option for "Module 1: Development Tools," which is expanded to show "Graded Assignment 1". The main content area displays information about "Graded Assignment 1". It includes the due date, instructions, troubleshooting tips, and a section to confirm if the user has attempted the assignment.

Here's a description of the image:
The image is a screenshot of a webpage about "Tools in Data Science". The left side is a navigation menu with "Tools in Data Science" highlighted. The right side displays "Course Links" and "Jan 2025 Links", each with a list of links to resources.

The course introduction has very important information. Many students who faced problems in Tools for Data Science in previous terms usually never read the intro. Please be diligent to read *everything carefully.*

Don’t gloss over these bits (they are expandable if you click on them) for eg…

Here's a description of the image:
The image is a list of bullet points with text on a dark gray background.
image text:
\* This course exposes you to real-life tools
\* This course is quite hard
\* Programming skills are a pre-requisite
\* We encourage learning by sharing

Here's the image description:
The image is a dark mode course description or review, formatted as text, probably for a website or learning platform. The content is structured with bullet points and key headings. It starts by stating that the course exposes students to "real-life tools". The next line says that the course is "quite hard" and then it provides student feedback, with key points such as the course has become harder, covers more material, and requires additional time. It also states that it requires a good understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts. It includes a call to action to take an assignment, and if the score is low, it's advised to drop the course. It concludes with prerequisites and further learning encouragement.

This course exposes you to real-life tools
▼ This course is quite hard
Here's students' feedback:
• It used to be an easy course until 2024. # # #
• Now it's hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #
• Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #
• LLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #
• The ROE is hard. #
You need a good understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.
Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you're ready for this course. Please drop this course in a later term if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.
