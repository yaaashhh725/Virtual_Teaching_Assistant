# graded-assignment-1-submission-not-shown

Hello,

I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.

You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.

Kind regards

Dear Sir,  
I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?

---

sir can you please allow us to submit it . like open the seek portal for a few mins . because we have worked hard to finished the assignment and all our hardwork will be in vain … please

Hello,  
I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9, so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.

---

Respected Sir,  
I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal  
According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?  
Thanks

[@23f2005471](/u/23f2005471)

Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).

Kind regards

Respected Sir/Madam,

I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox  
I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment  
and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this

Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??

I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.

I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.  
I got a total of 9.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission  
image description: The image is a screenshot of an online quiz or assessment question. The question states: "1) I have seen the Graded Assignment 1 available at this link and have attempted it." The user is presented with two radio button options: "Yes" and "No". Below the answer options, the feedback "No, the answer is incorrect." is displayed in red, along with a score of "0". The accepted answer is "Yes".

Good evening, I have submitted my GA1 in the ex website  
image description: The image is a screenshot of a webpage. The top of the page has a red banner indicating that the page ended at "Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST." The main content of the page lists some points about the context, including that the user can use any resources, and that it is hackable. There is a "Have questions?" section and then a section for the logged-in user's account information and a logout button. The page also displays a "Recent saves" section.

5. Browser may struggle. If you face loading issues, turn off security restrictions or try a different browser.
6. Use anything. You can use any resources you want. The Internet, ChatGPT, friends, whatever. Use any libraries or frameworks you want.
7. It's hackable. It's possible to get the answer to some questions by hacking the code for this quiz. That's allowed.
Should you take TDS this term?
• If this assignment takes you under 2 hours to complete, you will likely do OK in TDS.
• If you score above 8 / 10, you might get an S or A grade, with effort and luck.

The main part of the image displays a question asking if the student has seen the graded assignment and attempted it, with "Yes" and "No" options. The student selected "No", and a message indicates the answer is incorrect with a score of 0. There's also a note instructing the use of a student ID for the graded assignment.

Hi Mandy,

Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released).

Kind regards

I have done my GA1 and scored 10/10 still it’s showing 0 on my dashboard.  
Here's a description of the image:
The image is a screenshot of a webpage, likely related to a coding exercise or assessment. The top section shows a green header with the website address, due date (Sun, 26 Jan, 2025, 11:59 pm IST), and a score of 10/10. Below that, there's a code snippet with SQL-like syntax, followed by a "Correct" message, a description of the task (to get all rows where type is "Gold"), and buttons labeled "Check" and "Save". The lower section displays a "Submitted" message with a warning about overwriting the previous submission, and a note to save regularly.

Correct
Get all rows where the Type is "Gold". Ignore spaces and treat mis-spellings like GOLD, gold, etc. as "Gold". Calculate the sales as Units
Check Save

If you submit again, it will overwrite your previous submission and score.
Save regularly. Your last saved submission will be evaluated.

Thats not the dashboard.

We have checked your submissions. Unfortunately your last submission was 0 (on the 19th of Jan). Only the last submission is considered for evaluation not the previous ones.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Why is there a mismatch between the scores?

image description: The image is a light green rectangular box with rounded corners. The box has three lines of information, each with a "Reload" button to the left and then the date, time, and score associated with a save file. The top line reads "from 27/1/2025, 1:14:12 pm. Score: 8.5". The second line reads "from 22/1/2025, 8:14:11 pm. Score: 7.25". The third line reads "from 22/1/2025, 8:11:48 pm. Score: 7.25". Above these lines is the text "Recent saves".

Hi Yogesh,

There is no discrepancy, your last submission *before* the deadline was on 22nd Jan 8:14 pm. You scored 7.25, exactly as mentioned in your recent saves.

The higher score was on the 27th of Jan *after* the deadline.

Kind regards
