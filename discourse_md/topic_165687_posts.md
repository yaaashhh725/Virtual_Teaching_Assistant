Thank you for taking out time to meet today. It was great to meet you Sir, and was a great pleasant surprise to meet our wonderful TAs, [@carlton](/u/carlton) and [@jivraj](/u/jivraj) (and, TAs for Java and Statistics I too. sorry, I am unable to tag them with names) as well. I am inspired to continue learning deeper and more… such interactions are very helpful. Thank you.
