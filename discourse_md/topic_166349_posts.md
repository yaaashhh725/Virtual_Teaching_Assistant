# reattempt-graded-assignment-after-deadline

I missed a week’s worth of learning, and I’d like to catch up by attempting the assignments after going through the video tutorials. I’m not asking for grades as deadline is passed, just the opportunity to complete them for the sake of learning. I would really appreciate if this can be made possible.
