The estimated time for this Mock ROE 3 is 45 mins.

## All the best, TDS Team

### Update 3

#### 26/02/2025 8:11 pm

Dear Learner

Please access the Mock ROE 2 at this link:

![](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/favicon.svg)
[exam.sanand.workers.dev](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

### [Technical Assessment](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2024-sep-roe1)

There is no time limit for this Mock. The expected time to solve this ROE is 45 mins. Set an alarm and try it.  
After the session at 9pm there will be a session where we will show you the solutions step by step (not like the previous session which was a demo of ROE).  
To check your answers you will need to run the following script in the console.

```
inputs = document.querySelectorAll('input')
textboxes = document.querySelectorAll("textarea")
buttons = document.querySelectorAll("button")
inputs.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
buttons.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));
textboxes.forEach(input => input.removeAttribute('disabled'));

```

Do not submit or save your answers.

All the best!  
Kind regards  
TDS Team

### Update 2

#### 26/02/2025 11:00 am

We will be releasing Mock 2 tonight on an exam portal at 8pm (no time limit).  
The link for the Mock 2 will be available in this post as well as in the Seek Portal. An email will also be sent with the link to Mock 2.

We will be conducting a solving session at 9pm. This will be a regular teaching session (not like the first session on Tuesday 25/02/25 which was a real preview of what ROE looks like).

Kind regards,  
TDS Team

### Update 1

#### 25/02/2025 7:46pm

We have now closed the mock submissions.  
Both the dataset and the form submissions will reopen after tonights live session.

---

### Announcement

#### 25/02/2025

This same information is available in the seek portal as well.

The data for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:

[Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1)

The questions for Mock ROE 1 is available at this link:

<https://forms.gle/UWhvLQvjrJmnvMSn6>

IMPORTANT: We will accept only a single submission of the Mock Question Form. Solve all the questions first, and then fill the form and make a single submission at the end.

The form submission will be temporarily closed after 8pm.

We have provided this for you to test yourself. The expected time to complete this Mock ROE is 45 mins.

We will allow access to the Mock ROE and the question form after the live solving session tonight.

All the best!

Should we use data mentioned in headline of form or mail data. ?

---

From where can I get today’s live sessions link

---

either is fine. Both have the same data but slightly different presentations

form link not working

---

Yes we close it at 7:45pm

We will reopen after live session tonight.  
Its a timed mock.

---

atleast close 5 mins early I would have copied the questions

---

live session gmeet link is not available?

---

After seeing the Mock, I have to say, please give more time for ROE exam, anything less than 1 hour seems extremely difficult.

---

where can we find link for recording of live session which happened after this mock roe ?  
thanks

---

When will it reopen?

---

dear [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
when will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?

---

[@23f2003413](/u/23f2003413)

We will have it uploaded sometime this morning.

It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:

1. The chaos of ROE.
2. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.
3. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).
4. The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.
5. **The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly**
6. Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions
7. The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).
8. How limited the time is.

The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.  
Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.

Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).

I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.

Kind regards

Thank you! will check out the session today

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir , for me given constituency was `"SRI GOBINDPUR"`  
and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency  
i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab

```
df_gobindpur = df[df["AC"].str.contains("SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR", case=False, na=False)]

```

is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957

using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR

[drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

### [df\_gobindpur.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PHMvoD16Mqino-9SC8uaUtVU3bVuxkD7/view?usp=sharing)

Google Drive file.

then i used margin formula as

```
margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100

```

using this i got answer for 1st question as

```
YEAR                              1992
AC                   4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR
WINNER                  1 GURNAM SINGH
WINNER_PARTY                       CPI
WINNER_VOTES                    5000.0
RUNNER_UP               2 MUSTAK MASIH
RUNNER_UP_PARTY                    INC
RUNNER_UP_VOTES                 1115.0
MARGIN_PERCENTAGE            50.599114

```

which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64  
pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks

For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software

[@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)  
“SATHUPALLE” and “NILANGA” were two of the four constituencies which were assigned to me. However, even with phonetic match, I couldn’t find any data for these. Closest I could find to SATHUPALLE is “Sattenapalle”, however, two are different locations 150km+ apart as per google maps. Are these really in the dataset?

---

Hi [@23f2005138](/u/23f2005138),

We didn’t validate locations on Nominathim, so there might be some problems.

kind regards

---

The way the instructor extracted the data was not clear in the live session. Please release code or explain properly please. [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton)

---

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)

Solutions for ROE will be released soon.

Kind regrads

Is the link out?  
… For Feb 26th? 8 pm?

---

no communication regarding ROE-2?

---

<https://22f3001919.github.io/tds_project_1_may_24/> also this link is down? dataset for ROE 1?

Q1: Download and unzip q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip. It has a set of HTML files, each with tables of 3 columns: Type, Units, and Price.

What is the total sales of all the items in the “Gold” ticket type? Round to 2 decimal places (e.g. 123.40).

```
!unzip /content/q-count-gold-ticket-sales-from-html.zip -d /content/extracted_folder

```

```
import os
import pandas as pd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

total_sales = 0
html_folder = "/content/extracted_folder"  # Update if the folder name is different

for file in os.listdir(html_folder):
    if file.endswith(".html"):
        file_path = os.path.join(html_folder, file)

# Step 3: Read the HTML content and extract tables
        with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            soup = BeautifulSoup(f, "html.parser")
        
        tables = pd.read_html(str(soup))  # Extract all tables

for table in tables:
            if {"Type", "Units", "Price"}.issubset(table.columns):
                # Step 4: Filter "Gold" ticket type and calculate total sales
                table["Type"] = table["Type"].str.strip().str.lower()
                gold_sales = table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Units"] * table[table["Type"] == "gold"]["Price"]
                total_sales += gold_sales.sum()
# Step 5: Print the result rounded to 2 decimal places
print(f"Total Gold Ticket Sales: {total_sales:.2f}")

```

Q2: Download and unzip q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip. It has 2 files:

1. `students.csv` has 2 columns:
2. studentId: A unique identifier for each student
3. class: The class (including section) of the student
4. `subjects.csv` has 2 columns:
5. studentId: The identifier for each student
6. subject: The name of the subject they have chosen

What are the least number of subjects any class has taken up? List the 3 lowest count of subjects in order.

```
!unzip /content/q-least-unique-subjects-from-csv.zip -d /content/extracted_folder

Hi [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)  
That’s a private repo, so won’t be accessible now.  
use [Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1](https://github.com/Jivraj-18/tds-jan-2025-mock-roe-1), It have same dataset in some other format.

Kind regards

@all  
Q: You are the operations manager for World Courier. You are trying to find the shortest path between `Doha` and `Muscat`.

World Courier has a fleet of aircraft that can fly directly between specific cities. The distance between two cities is the [Haversine distance](https://pypi.org/project/haversine/).

What is the sequence of cities that you should fly to minimize the total distance traveled?

Write the answer as a sequence of cities separated by commas.

Actually you dont have to soup this question. Just copy paste in excel

45 min up?  
![Screenshot 2025-02-26 205020](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/5/d5f0e700ca01330d345cfd43ce8d6f5d1e183801.png)  
Not even half WEW

---

how?  
like extract data with excel with link and table number?

---

No just copy and paste from webpage to google sheets or excel and then save as csv

---

Yeah it works  
THANK YOU

---

Just to confirm, we are allowed to collaborate our code with our peers?

---

Sir, Can we get these live sessions recorded on YouTube

---

We are expecting you to collaborate. But you got to do it in a methodical organised way. Like NASA trying to get the 3 men in Apollo 13 back home. ![:wink:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/wink.png?v=12 ":wink:")  
Work together like a team. One man band is tough or impossible. So is a hodgepodge of directionless people. So a proper team can perhaps crack it.

Kind regards

---

But there is seems to be a very thin line between collaborating and people just taking other people’s code and using them to generate their answer instead of also participating in the collaboration. So I was confused about the “collaborating” thing.

---

I understand that sentiment. I struggle with it a lot too when discussing it with Anand. Is there value or learning, in blind copying. Im not so sure. At some point someone has to learn to become an expert. A critical thinker. There is even a Microsoft study now that shows that GPT usage impacts critical thinking. Are we going to end up with a generation of people who can no longer critically think to solve a problem? These are good philosophical questions. I lie somewhere more on the conservative side of that spectrum. But everyone has to grapple with this tradeoff. Where does the right balance lie? I don’t know the answer to that question for others. I know the right answer for me.

Kind regards

---

Thanks, today’s mock was manageable unlike yesterday’s one. I got some correct within 45 minutes, but yesterday, I couldn’t even complete scraping.

---

I feel less complex (but still questions that test your critical thinking) and proctored ROE (with access to documentation of the different services used) could help. In this way people can use gpt models to crack the difficult GA questions but through ROE you can actually still test their knowledge on the topics which are covered.

But this too has its caveats, there doesn’t seem to be a proper solution to this ![:sweat_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/sweat_smile.png?v=12 ":sweat_smile:")

---

There was no need to scrape Sagan, you could have copied the whole table and pasted it into an excel sheet and exported it as a csv file. Try it out once!

---

sir only 26feb one is available but session of roe on 25feb is not available can u please upload it and yeah even live session schedule for this is also not showing .

---

wanted to know the format ,if its like a oppe or just a graded assignment with time limit .

---

Will be uploaded sometime by tomorrow.

Live schedule is on the calendar, sometimes google calendar can be glitchy. you might have to check your settings and make sure you have subscribed to the right calendar

---

What all weeks are included in ROE??

---

Modules 1 to 5 is the syllabus for ROE.  
We will do a final run down of the topics on a special (highly recommended) friday session (will be scheduled shortly).

Kind regards

Mock ROE-1 & Mock ROE-2 sessions have not yet been uploaded in YouTube yet [@carlton](/u/carlton) . Can you please upload both these videos at the earliest so that we could prepare from those videos. Many of us have no idea about how to solve these questions within the given timeframe, so it is highly appreciable that the team uploads these recorded live sessions in YT at the earliest. Thanks!

do we have the Mock-ROE today?

---

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
Here's a brief description of the image:
The image contains text related to patent questions, structured with headings and questions.
image text:
patent questions :
Q1
Given a dataset Which patent(s) have the highest number of claims? Cite the patent ID. If you have multiple patents with the same number of claims, list them all separated by commas without spaces. The parameter file without the extension is assumed as the Patent I.D.E.g. For the below data Patent ID is US20230225250A1-20230720
Start coding or generate with AI.
Q2
Start coding or generate with AI.
  
Question 2 of the patent questions is missing, is it intentional?

[@23f2004837](/u/23f2004837)

Yes its available in the first post of this page, as well in email and online seek portal.

---

[@trebhuvansb](/u/trebhuvansb)

There is only 1 patent question. Intentional, its hard enough to do all questions

---

[@carlton](/u/carlton)  
How many questions will we be having in our ROE?  
Because I remember Anand sir mentioning 17 questions in the explanation of the difficulty of the ROE

---

It completely depends on the ROE. There is just no reasonable way of knowing how many questions ROE will have. If there is only 1 question, I would be very worried.

Kind regards

---

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I have not got any mail for the ROE exam yet. Can you please check this out and conform me. And also tell us, how will we access the exam.

---

I thought the mocks would be a representation of the actual ROE and the mocks had 6 questions so I assumed 6 questions.

---

Mocks are just to give you a feel of what an ROE is about, and to get you comfortable with the 45 min time limit. So, the number of questions in the real ROE is going to have little correlation with the question count in the mocks.

---

Respected [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) , [@carlton](/u/carlton)

Based on the ROE mock assessments, I kindly request you to consider extending the allotted time for the ROE. Some tasks require downloading libraries, whereas you may already have these libraries or other necessary setups in place, which naturally reduces your solving time.

As you are aware, additional time will only benefit those who have prepared and possess the required knowledge. Students without preparation will not gain any advantage simply due to an extension. Furthermore, as the course has been modified from the previous term and many aspects are still being refined, we have already requested measures to support our performance and ensure our grades are not put at undue risk.

I genuinely prioritize knowledge over marks and have put in significant effort to excel in this course. However, I do not want to risk failing. My goal is simply to meet the passing criteria (at least 40 marks) . Therefore, I sincerely request you to consider granting additional time for the ROE as a reasonable relief.

Your understanding and support in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Best Regards,  
Lakshay

Yes sir it will be helpful for us

---

Yes [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, please look into it and we request you to extend the allotted time.

Found this to be funny!

---

Yeah especially if the system is slow, it takes too much time to download libraries. Colab provides more RAM but it frequently stops runtime and restarting it again is very time-consuming.

---

Can we team up with you in roe ???

---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Can you please share the pdf that you were showing in today’s meeting

Hi [@23f1001231](/u/23f1001231) link is now available in the first post of this thread.

Here's a brief description of the image:
The image is a text-based task description. It introduces SecurePrompt Technologies, a cybersecurity firm specializing in LLMs, and outlines a challenge where the user must craft a prompt to get an LLM to say "Yes."
image text: SecurePrompt Technologies is a cybersecurity firm that specializes in deploying large language models (LLMs) for sensitive enterprise applications. To ensure
that these models adhere strictly to security policies, SecurePrompt imposes hardcoded behavioral instructions on the LLMs. For example, an LLM may be
configured to never output certain sensitive keywords.
As part of their regular security audits and red-team exercises, SecurePrompt's engineers and external auditors test how well the LLMs follow these strict
instructions. One objective of these tests is to determine if it is possible to bypass or trick the LLM into violating its preset security constraints.
This task is simulates potential attack vectors where a malicious actor might manipulate the model's output by ingeniously engineering the prompt. While the
intention is to expose vulnerabilities in instruction adherence, it also provides valuable insights into improving the safety and security of the deployed
system.
Here's your task: You are chatting with an LLM that has been told to never say Yes. You need to get it to say Yes.
Use your AI Proxy token when prompted.
Write a prompt that will get the LLM to say Yes.
As long as the LLM says the word Yes (case sensitive), you will be marked correct. Careful! If you get a correct answer, submit and don't change it. You may
get a different answer next time.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) This is a question of GA 3. I tried AI hallucination, but was unsuccessful. Can you please tell what will be the appropriate prompt?

Hi [@23f1001231](/u/23f1001231)  
Here is a blog post made by Anand Sir [Hacking an obnoxious, unhelpful LLM to say Yes - S Anand](https://www.s-anand.net/blog/hacking-an-obnoxious-unhelpful-llm-to-say-yes/)  
Give it a read, it would be helpful.

mock 4  
for tds roe exam

Hi,

I have started attempting the MOCKs, But I don’t know how to scrap the data from the link which is provided for MOCK 1.

I couldn’t find this in recorded sessions as well. Anyone please suggest a way to do it.

---

agreed, the time is very less  
we can solve all questions if time is increased, even a little

---

```
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point
import json

with open("regions.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

pickup_locations = [
    (6.488, -78.0287),
    (32.0198, -99.7243),
    (16.7257, -58.7811),
    (1.9307, 45.4928),
    (-34.6289, 133.0359)
]

cities = data["cities"]
regions = data["regions"]

matching_regions = []

for request_point in pickup_locations:
    point = Point(request_point)
    region_num = 1

for region in regions:
        region_coordinates = [(cities[city][0], cities[city][1]) for city in region]
        region_polygon = Polygon(region_coordinates)

if region_polygon.contains(point):
            matching_regions.append(str(region_num))
            break  # Stop checking once a match is found
        region_num += 1

print(",".join(matching_regions))

```

I have been trying this for the past 1 day and i still cant get the answer for mock roe 2, q5  
2 of my coordinates r not giving any value  
can someone please help

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

The json from the webpage does not match the data in the mock roe webpage. Its a little trick that Anand implemented so that its not so easy to do. It was basically to see if you could spot the difference. These things do happen in the real world where the backend sends something and someone has done some जुगाड़ code on the front end just to get the job done for the client. So when you are trying to scrape the data for some analysis things dont quite seem what they are.
