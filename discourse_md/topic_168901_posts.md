I will try and add in the morning but who doesn’t like Good PRs? Also mentioning [@23f2005325](/u/23f2005325) (Aishik) here for his wonderful PR which I have now merged.

Failure is part of life. My laptop hanged and despite having all the needed resources I panicked and the exam went the way it went. I take this as a lesson. This resource will be refined further. I thank everyone involved. I am glad that many benefitted and were actually able to score well.
