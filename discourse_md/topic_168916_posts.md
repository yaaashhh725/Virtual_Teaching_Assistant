Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
My Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section - its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner.

Regards,  
Ajit

No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs we get bitten by.

Kind regards

---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) any updates on the Project 1 results?

---

We are releasing them today. You will get an email with lots of goodies in it ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=14 ":slight_smile:")

Kind regards

It is more frightening now…

---

If we failed in project1 then we will be awarded free marks in Project2 Please conform that [@carlton](/u/carlton) at least give us some awards for our hard work (Summer special offer), what do you say?

---

I think something heavy is coming… But it’s 9:30, and nothing’s here yet. Taking their time, I see!![:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes.png?v=14 ":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:")

---

We have marks but we are sending you a package of items as well, for your benefit.

---

We have been waiting for you for a month… and our patience is wearing thin

You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.  
i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25

Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.

---

Sir can you check and say if I passed or not. The link that I submitted for project 1 in the gform contains two links. I wrote ‘and’ between two website link.

Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I haven’t received any email regarding **Project 1** results. Could you please confirm if there’s an issue?  
my mail id: 23f2000798@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

---

No issue with your submission, you will get a good score.

Kind regards

---

Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified. You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated.

Kind regards
