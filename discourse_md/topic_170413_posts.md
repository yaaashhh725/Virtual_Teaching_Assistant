Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) ,

Will this session be recorded and shared later?  
It conflicts with live session of BA and that session is specially told that It will not be recorded.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I too prefer a recording. I did not even attend the session due to personal work which I couldn"t avoid. Pls support

[@kushabarodekar](/u/kushabarodekar) [@Muthupalaniappan](/u/muthupalaniappan)

As usual recording will be uploaded to youtube.
