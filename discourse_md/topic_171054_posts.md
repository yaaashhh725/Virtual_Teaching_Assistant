I would like to share that we have successfully completed **TDS Project 2**, solving **46/57** cases dynamically via **Azure after deployment**! We also tested it with our friends’ **GA questions**, and it’s working as expected.

This project was a **team effort** by me and two friends [ [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654) and [@23f2004637](/u/23f2004637) ], and we are thrilled with the results post-deployment.

I would love the opportunity to **demonstrate our project** to **TA and Anand Sir** in a **Google Meet session** on **March 31st** (since I have OPPE on the 29th and 30th).

If you can spare some time for a quick look at our project, it would be awesome! Looking forward to your response.

Hi [@23f2005702](/u/23f2005702) [@lakshaygarg654](/u/lakshaygarg654)  
Firstly, congratulations on your success. And surely you can demonstrate your project. It would be great if you demonstrate it in today’s live session at 8pm. Otherwise next week is all about project 2 discussion.

Thank you for the opportunity! However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my **Azure API URL would be exposed**, and since it incurs **costs per usage**, I need to keep it secure.

I’d prefer a **private meet** to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!

That’s amazing [@23f2005702](/u/23f2005702) ,  
so far I have completed till 44 Qs and deployed it on azure too !! Mine is solving around 40 correctly out of these 44 (checked with another user’s login on the portal).

I can’t join the meet since I’m out of station and don’t have PC access. I also have other coursework, so I’ll be available for a meet from the 31st onwards

Congrats for your project mate!  
Just wanted to ask how did you frame your questions for the Graded Assignments? Cause that will help me complete mine.  
Thanks in advance
