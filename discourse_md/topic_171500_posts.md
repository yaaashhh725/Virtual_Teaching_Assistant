[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@POD\_TEAM](/u/pod_team) how to peer review for GA7 where is the link??

Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done.  
(roughly 3 days before end term).

Kind regards

What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can’t leave it blank.

Just put zero there. Since all the quantitative answers are positive.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?

Here's a brief description of the image:
The image is a screenshot of a Gmail inbox. The search query is "peer review". There are two emails displayed, both with the sender "22t1 se2002". Both emails contain a specific HTML file attachment. The file name "23f3003944.html" is present in both emails.
