# ga7-peer-grading-clarification

[@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir, I want to clarify something about the peer grading process. Some of the files of the student assigned to me are not accessble and others are missing. How am I to grade each thing? From what I understand analysis must be graded based on the shared files but if im not able to access them what should I do? I think requesting view access might violate the spirit of the grading exercise.

Please help me out on what to do. Thanks.

Here's a description of the image:
The image is a screenshot from Google Sheets, displaying a "You need access" message. The screen's main elements are a form asking for permission to access the document and illustrations, and a prompt to request access or switch accounts.

Upon checking further, in the assignment we were asked only to share access with se2002@study.iitm.ac.in . So I think all of us might have this issue. what do we do?

1. Create a new blank Google Sheet workbook, named ga.7.1.rollno (replace 'rollno' with your IITM
roll number excluding the domain).
2. Share with editing rights to se2002@study.iitm.ac.in. If you do not do this step first, on a blank
workbook we will not consider your submission.
