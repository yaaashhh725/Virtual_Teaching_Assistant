# repeat-course

Even if I pass in end term TDS, Can I repeat the course in next term because I missed project1 and my CGPA will go down because of it?

This is my last term of diploma. So, can I take 1 diploma course and rest degree courses in next term?

Yes, you can.  
More details given in student handbook. Search for repeat courses.

image description: The image is a document about repeating a course for improvement. The document is titled "12.5.3 Repeating a Course for Improvement." The document explains that courses with A, B, C, D or E grades are eligible for repeating. It also states that students can repeat courses to improve their grade and the highest grade will be recorded in the transcript. There is also a note at the bottom of the document that recommends learners try and progress with new courses instead of repeating courses for improvement, unless it is necessary.

TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA.

Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA. **We never recommend taking TDS for grade improvement.** If you have passed it, its better to move on.

Just as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA (they take it as an elective).

So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S. Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time.

This is not up to us. We make adjustments within assignments and projects and we have done that already. For course level bonuses, that is the discretion of operations.
