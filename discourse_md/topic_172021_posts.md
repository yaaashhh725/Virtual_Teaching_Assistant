# email-in-ga-7

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir in google form it is written to submit email address of peer but the mail TDS team has sent has 3 drive links .so we have to submit drive links or like create the email by adding “@ds.study.iitm.ac.in” after the username

---

If you actually open the drive link you will see the student email. You have to use that email for submitting the form.
