# bonus-marks-in-tds-for-jan-25

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) Greetings sir!  
Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?  
As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?

Thank you and Regards  
Akshit

Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.  
However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.  
Is this information available to everyone [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir?

---

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
I hope you are doing well.

As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.

Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.

We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.

Looking forward to your kind consideration.

The Same happened to me. They should have informed this before.

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) same happens for me also sir plz look into this matter.

**[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)**  
There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.

Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.

I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.

**[@carlton](/u/carlton)**, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.

---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir ,

This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ?  
Kindly consider

---

same for me also …  
Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA.  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

---

Exactly! This should have been informed beforehand.  
It’s really unfair

---

It the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something about this.

---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this.

Regards:  
Akash

[@carlton](/u/carlton) I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has unfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all with silence and a smile.

---

Good evening [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir,  
I hope you are well

According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7.

Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment.

We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.

Best regards,  
Palaash V. Upadhyay

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)  
Yes sir , we have completed all the previous ga but not able to do week 7 , we feel that the bonus should be given to all on the basis of ga and not only on week 7 . Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given . Please do consider our request . Thank you

---

Exactly , They have to informed this earlier , that week 7 have peer marks too , and now bonus too  
in the grading doc , they removed peer marks , so i thought it was removed , but its not

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)

The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand)  
Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.  
Thank you

---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge

If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this

Thanking you

waiting for your answer

To all the people who are posting in this thread, I kindly request you to get the correct facts and data before starting a new thread.

So here are the first steps towards making this thread a more informed one:

1. What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?
2. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?
3. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?
4. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?
5. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?
6. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?

Patiently waiting for all your responses.

---

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) this is really unfair, on one hand you all are giving 0 to project 1 submission even because of slighest mistake and on the other giving free marks to students who attempted the GA7. Most of us were not able to attend the GA7 and it was not mentioned beforehand that we have 5 marks bonus for GA7. Please give the peer review bonus to those who did not attempt the GA7 or else it is really unfair for other students.

---

Please refer to my earlier post. Do try to answer the questions in those. And then try to argue with [@carlton](/u/carlton) , [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) and [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini) about fairness.

Greetings!

I came across your response in the Discourse thread regarding the bonus marks and GA7, and I wanted to reach out respectfully to seek some clarification.

I did go through the grading policy and the bonus marks section, but I’m still a bit confused about your message in the thread — especially regarding the specific steps we should take or refer to in order to understand the bonus marks related to GA7 and peer reviews. For ROE and the Week 4 GA, bonus marks were mentioned here on Discourse

Could you kindly guide me on what exactly we should refer to (such as any email, document, or past policy) and what steps are expected from us to be eligible for the bonus?  
Also, would students who completed all 5 assignments (but missed GA7) have any alternative way to earn bonus marks through peer reviews or other contributions?

Apologies if I’ve missed something already mentioned. Your clarification would be really helpful for me and others who are in a similar situation.

[@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) Thank you so much for your time and guidance.

Warm regards,  
*Mishkat Chougule*

I hope this message finds you well [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) sir.

Firstly, I would like to sincerely apologize for any misunderstandings that may have arisen. I have the utmost respect for the grading system and for the esteemed professors at IITM, and I deeply value the effort put into the course.

However, as a student, I am hoping to clarify the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course.

Addressing the queries you raised in your post:

> 1. What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document?

In previous modules, such as Project 1, bonus marks were awarded for completing additional tasks (1 bonus mark per task if the code handled them correctly). Similarly, in GA4, bonus marks were given for replying in Discourse. These bonus marks, however, were specific to the respective modules and did not affect the final grading.

> 2. What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS?

I am not fully aware of the policies adopted in previous terms for the TDS course.

> 3. Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7?

I have read the email regarding GA7 and the associated bonus marks. The email states that:

> Dear Learner,  
> DEADLINE: 10th April, 2025 23:59:59pm  
> GA7 requires you to submit 3 peer evaluations, so that you may be graded for your submission.  
> Please find the form link below to submit your evaluations.  
> <https://forms.gle/DhBW4xdKyv7hXhXD9>  
> AFTER completing your initial 3 peer reviews which were sent in the previous email,  
> if you submit 5 additional reviews, you will be awarded upto 5 BONUS MARKS to your final T score. For example if your final TDS score is 75, doing all 5 extra peer reviews can boost your final score in TDS to 80.  
> You will have to submit the form 5 times (1 for each peer). Use the same form link to submit 5 different reviews. Your Bonus score will still be based on the metrics derived for the initial 3 peer reviews, but scaled for 5 peer reviews.  
> You have been given the peer submissions as links to HTML files which you have to download and view in a browser.

> 4. Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus?

From the information in the email, I infer that students who complete the additional reviews are eligible for bonus marks, which will be added to their overall total marks.

> 5. Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus?

My peers and I have worked diligently to complete all required tasks, including the ROE and projects. Earning additional bonus marks is certainly a challenging milestone, and we understand that it requires considerable effort.

> 6. After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus?

Unfortunately, I can’t follow the instructions because I did not receive the email about submitting extra peer reviews, as it appears to have been sent to those who participated in GA7.  
…

Given this context, I would appreciate it if you could kindly clarify the situation for students who completed all GAs from 1 to 6 (or did their best 4 GAs) but did not participate in GA7. Specifically, I would like to understand why only those who completed GA7 are receiving the bonus marks email regarding peer reviews.

Please note that I ask this purely for clarification and with the utmost respect for the professors and the grading system, as I have no intention of creating controversy. I simply wish to understand the criteria.  
Thank you for your time and consideration [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) sir.

Best regards,  
Akshit Mittal

The mail you have pasted has definitely come from one of your peer in the course. You can try clicking the form, evaluation criteria for reviews have been provided in the form itself. If in further doubt, try doing one review with the peer who shared the email. Now try answering Q5.

And in case you have more doubts, you can refer to the live session that happened today. I believe most of it was spent on clarifying what the bonus is for.

Completely understand. And we too are trying to help you understand the criteria through these discussions. And believe me, we are also learning in the process.

---

Yes [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) sir, I did receive this email from one of my peers, although we are not closely acquainted, making it difficult to complete a review with the peer who shared the email.

Since the beginning of the course, it has been emphasized that the **TDS course focuses more on teamwork** and collaborative learning than individual study. I fully believe this concept and worked together with my group. I created Colab files for 4 GAs for my peers(more than 250 peers must have benefited from it), and **my peers supported me with Project 1 and 2.** **They were mainly responsible for helping me score the full marks in the first two minutes of the ROE** release and we had a meeting after ROE, which was scheduled with you.

I understand that earning bonus marks for GA7 will be difficult. However, I had no opportunity to participate in this process even after submitting six GAs, while attempting only GA7 (which I understand presents a slim chance) may grant me 5 bonus marks. I acknowledge that the chances are difficult, but many of my peers who didn’t submit GA7, including myself, feel we deserve an opportunity.

Sir, I am not questioning the grading system but I think it would have been helpful if we had known earlier that peer reviews in GA7 would be part of earning bonus marks. In GA4, Anand Sir made it clear that anyone who asked or answered a question in the GA4 discussion would receive bonus marks but these were specific to GA4 (e.g., a score of 110 out of 100), not the overall grading.

To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system. I am not pointing out mistakes, but I just feel the information about the bonus could have been shared more clearly.

Finally, I want to thank everyone with whom I have connected during this course. I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible, especially after submitting six GAs, the ROE, and two projects. I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.

I’d also like to mention that with the end-term exams just three days away, most of us will be focusing on preparing for them. However, I trust you’ll definitely take our concerns into consideration, and we remain hopeful for clarity regarding the bonus marks.  
Thank you once again for your understanding.

---

Hello sir, I too did not do the GA7 since the best 4 out of 7 would be considered and I had my college examinations during that time.

I was not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and I have not received any mails regarding it.

---

I agree with all my peers. If there was a bonus on the course grade T which would make a huge difference on the final grade I think it should have been told to us upfront.

---

Bonus marks criteria should have been clarified before the deadline of week 7 GA so we all could have attempted it.

---

It’s really unfair. We were not aware that doing reviews for GA7 would grant bonus marks and we have not received any mails regarding it.

You could have informed us beforehand. 5 marks really makes a huge difference. I trust you guys to make it fair for everyone

---

It is good to see that you have been actively collaborating with your peers and both have benefitted from this. Here is the main query that most people are having:

![](https://dub1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/user_avatar/discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/23f2004636/48/86136_2.png) 23f2004636:

> To be clear, my query is why I am not being afforded the opportunity. I believe there may have been some confusion or lack of clear communication regarding the bonus system.

Here is my response, and I have consulted with the course instructors before sharing this:

Every term in TDS, both instructors and students are not aware of what bonuses are going to be given out at the start of term. Bonus activities are created at any point, at the discretion of the course team, and the information is not disseminated in a wide fashion. It’s primarily a reward mechanic for those that really are interested in engaging in the whole breadth of the course. For instance, in the last two terms the bonus activities required them to post their solutions in Discourse where the problem statement.

The course team do not invent GAs for the sake of giving opportunities for scoring marks. They are opportunities to learn and put that learning to use. Another goal is for the GAs to be opportunities to learn by collaborating with each other.

192 students took that opportunity to engage with GA7. If no one is interested in doing the GA, then why should the team take the effort to create it? Would you rather prefer that we make it mandatory for all students to do all GAs (by making GAA = average of all GA Scores)? Some courses do that. We were very lenient in our GA scoring because the course is tough. Students benefitted from that leniency. Should we reverse our leniency so that everyone “gets the opportunity to get bonus marks?” Think about this

As a course team, they did not know beforehand that they were going to give opportunities for any bonuses when GA 7 was created. So there was no information to give. Please do understand that the course team do not knowingly hide things from students (that’s a viewpoint that some students seem to suggest with their posts or at least).

When we saw that some students were taking the effort to do GA7, we decided that we would give them an opportunity as a reward for their diligence, to try and obtain some bonus marks. Are you jealous of their diligence?

It is extraordinary that it appears you would prefer if those students, who actually put in the effort, would not be given the opportunity! You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all. They thought it was worth the effort **before** there was any chance of a bonus. And now you begrudge them that reward for their own diligence.

Once again reiterating this point - Bonus marks are given for activities to students at the discretion of the course team. It always has been. And it has never been widely available to all students in past terms of TDS either. This term is no exception. They are never decided beforehand. They are created as and when there seems to be an appropriate opportunity to reward students for their effort.

The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity. But it’s not guaranteed for them either. They have to put in a significant coordinated effort with their peers to actually achieve that. In other words, it’s not a freebie.

I had promised to provide the distribution of people who did GA7 both in terms of number of assignments done and average score in GAA. Here is the data below:

| # Assignments Done | # students |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 42 |
| 1 | 33 |
| 2 | 22 |
| 3 | 19 |
| 4 | 23 |
| 5 | 28 |

| Assignment\_Score | # students |
| --- | --- |
| 0-10 | 75 |
| 11-20 | 19 |
| 21-30 | 15 |
| 31-40 | 9 |
| 41-50 | 13 |
| 51-60 | 7 |
| 61-70 | 11 |
| 71-80 | 12 |
| 81-90 | 10 |
| 91-100 | 17 |

---

Thank you for sharing the data [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) Sir

The data clearly supports my assumption that the majority of students attempted GA7 primarily to secure 100% in GAA, or to boost their GAA scores, with learning being a secondary priority.  
Anyway, it is what it is.  
Thankyou Sir

---

Exactly and no one cares about that fact or try to understand it.

---

**[@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) Sir**,  
Thank you for the detailed explanation. I just have one sincere doubt:

As you mentioned, the intention behind the GA7 bonus is to reward extra effort in GAs—but why are 5 bonus marks being added to the **total course marks**, instead of awarding **15/100 of the total** to those who did GA7 exceptionally well?

Students like me, who have consistently scored 100% in all GAs (excluding GA7) and have been actively participating in the Discourse forum from the beginning, seem to be left out. Don’t we deserve some recognition for our consistent efforts too?

It’s not about jealousy—it’s about acknowledging those who have put in their day and night from the start, completing every GA diligently and earning bonus marks as per the criteria already defined for earlier GAs.

I’m only concerned about **my own marks**, and I just wish for a fair system that values consistent effort across the term.

Thank you for your time and understanding.  
[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)

---

Exactly my point, there is no mention about this.

Bonus marks should be added out of 15 and not above that for T score calculation.

Otherwise it SHOULD mentioned in Grading Document.

---

Thanks for the clarification. I completely understand that bonus marks are at the discretion of the course team and are meant to reward diligence and deeper engagement — which is fair.

However, I just want to point out a potential nuance: Many of the 192 students who did GA7 may have done so *not* for extra learning but simply to ensure their top 4 GAs included 4 full scores (e.g., to replace a lower-scoring GA). So the distinction between diligence-for-learning and diligence-for-grade-maximizing becomes blurred.

Now that bonus marks are announced *after* the deadline, those who already had 4 perfect scores and skipped GA7 based on the stated structure (top 4 out of 7) are essentially penalized for playing the game by the original rules — not for a lack of diligence or engagement.

I’m not questioning the bonus system itself, just pointing out that such surprises can unintentionally favor certain strategies over others — and more transparency around this in future terms might help students make better-informed decisions without second-guessing themselves later.

---

Sir, why is GA7 given the atmost priority and the bonus of GA7 is not awarded to GA7 alone but is awarded as bonus to the entire total score of the course.

If the team wants to award the bonus marks for the consistent performance then they should consider the best 5 or 6 GAs and award bonus accordingly. It is unfair that those who just attempted GA7 are been given bonus marks to the entire course. If you wish to provide bonus marks then provide the bonus marks for GA7 alone, the same way as it was done for GA4.

The main issue is that the bonus marks concept was never informed prior. The team should not take actions at random as it would affect many students. As per grading document, only best 4 out of 7 GAs were supposed to be considered. Even if the team wishes to give the bonus mark then it should be given to the GA7 alone and not entire total score.

Sir as per the current logic, say a person just attends GA7 alone and doesnt attend any another thing then he would also be awarded bonus 5 marks to his total score just because of the fact that they **attended** GA7. Whereas students who have been submitting Ga1 to 6 and werent able to submit GA7 alone as per current logic are not being considered for the bonus mark. This is unfair.

Please think from our side.

Regards  
Karthik

Sir, this sounds reasonably fair. But, what about the students who were lethargic in probably week 1 or week 2, thinking that they can solve the GAs of later weeks? They also get benefitted from this.

I think the attitude of these students is the same as those who skipped GA& as they got 100% GAA within the first five or six weeks

I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the 5 bonus marks for GA7 and further elaborate on the impact this may have on overall grades.

As outlined in the grading document, the best 4 out of 7 GA assignments carry a total of 15 marks. Since many students, including myself, scored well in our best 4 assignments, which were prioritized as we aimed to maximize our grades, we did not attempt GA7. The bonus marks for GA7 were announced after the deadline, which has led to a concern that this may create an imbalance in the overall grading.

For students who excelled in their top 4 assignments, the additional 5 marks from GA7 may not significantly alter their overall grade, as they have already demonstrated strong performance. Conversely, those who struggled initially and attempted GA7 in hopes of improving their grade may benefit more from this bonus. This could inadvertently disadvantage those of us who strategically focused on the highest scoring opportunities available to us.

Given that the bonus marks were introduced after grades were finalized, I respectfully ask if there’s a possibility to consider an adjustment in these

Thank you for taking the time to respond in detail. I’d like to respectfully share a few clarifications in response to some of the points raised.

With due respect sir, I want to clarify that in my original message, I stated:

*“I am not questioning why others who submitted GA7 are eligible for a bonus, but I am simply asking why I am not eligible…I know that the world is much more than 5 marks, but I am only seeking clarity on the situation.”*

As mentioned above, my intention was never to express **jealousy**. It was simply an enquiry for clarity, especially around the communication and criteria related to the bonus system. The assumption that those who did not attempt GA7 chose not to put in effort is not accurate, respectfully.

> You have not been able to avail the opportunity because you decided that doing GA 7 is not worth the effort at all.

I would like to point out that many of us, myself included, showed consistent diligence by completing and submitting GA1 through GA6. **Personally, I solved GA5 and GA6 even after solving my Best 4 GAs purely for the learning experience**, knowing they wouldn’t necessarily impact my grade directly. I never avoided GA7 out of carelessness—I simply prioritized the fact that only the best 4 GA scores would count. This is not a lack of effort or interest in the subject matter.

Further, you mentioned:

> The 192 students that decided to do GA7 deservedly have that opportunity.

I completely respect the effort put in by those students.  
However, I would like to offer another perspective: what if some among those 192 had not completed their best 4 GAs prior to GA7? Meanwhile, those of us who consistently completed all previous GAs(excluding GA7) from the start are now excluded from this opportunity—not due to lack of interest, but due to lack of communication.

If the bonus is truly a recognition of effort *specific to GA7*, then it might be more fair to reflect that in the **GA7 score** only, not in the **overall course total**, which affects students who were consistently involved across the term.

I know I’m still learning and have a long way to go—there’s so much about the world, professionalism, and fairness that I hope to understand better through experiences and guidance of professors and through the exposure from the college. But I also believe that seeking clarity is part of that learning.

Thank you once again for reading my message and considering my point of view.

Thank you for the response sir, however my doubt was regarding a different issue.

It is not that I am jealous of their diligence or anything, its simply that even from the data you provided above, it seems that a majority of students, 141 out of the 192 students have not actually even done 4 assignments. So they might have done GA7 for the 4 GAA criteria, not just due to diligence. Once again I am not stating that they were all like that, but rather it is a possibility.

Another issue is that a lot of students might have originally worked hard on earlier assignments to score well but may not have had the time for later assignments such as college students like myself who have end term examinations ongoing currently. Since I saw that I had already put in the effort to do all 6 assignments prior, I only did not do the GA7 since it clashed with my examinations.

Once again I am not blaming the instructors for this situation sir but the bonus 5 marks can very well change which grade we get in the end, which is the reason why I have created this message. The students who have attempted GA7 do deserve extra marks for their work but if others were informed of the extra 5 marks then we may have also taken part in it, even if we had other prior commitments.

Thank you once again for reading this message sir and kindly consider our point of view.

Sir, as said in this another students’ post, i would also like to bring your notice to the fact that most of those 192 students who attempted the GA7 have not done 4 assignments. This shows their “diligence” which you are awarding them for. Whereas the students like us who have been submitting all the projects and the assignments GA1 to 6, how can the team conclude that just because we didnt submit GA7 we are not diligent enough to be awarded the bonus marks.

Shouldnt the bonus marks be awarded to those students who have been submitting literally all 2 projects and 6 assignments(6/7 i.e 85% of the assignments)? How could the team decide to award bonus 5 marks to the overall score just to those students based on a single assignment( namely GA7). We are genuinely struggling, and we are requesting bonus marks based on that. Please don’t misunderstand our request as jealousy — it comes from a place of hardship.

How can a student who submitted 1 assignment make him more diligent than those who have been submitting 2 projects and 6 assignments. I think if you plan to award bonus marks you should consider best 5 or 6 assignments and not just based on a single assignment.

Just because we didnt submit a assignment(GA7) why are we being deprived of the bonus marks which was not even informed of. If you want to provide the bonus marks then you can also consider the best 4 assignments as well as it would also show the students’ interest and diligence as you said. If you want to consider for the bonus marks you can consider any assignment right, why just GA7 is the question. You can also award the bonus marks based of GA-1 or GA-2 or so. I think the diligence which are talking of, should be measured based on consistent performance and not just based on a single assignment.

Regards  
Karthik

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@jkmadathil](/u/jkmadathil) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  
We have sent a couple of messages regarding the fairness of bonus marks to the above discourse post but no satisfactory reply has been provided. Could you please look into it and provide an update.  
We appreciate fairness in this matter.

---

[@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Sir,  
I just wanted to request you to kindly look into the matter regarding the GA7 peer review bonus marks. Many of us are still waiting for a response on Discourse, and it’s becoming a bit concerning. Would really appreciate it if you could help us get some clarity on this.

Thank you!

Hi everyone,

A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights.

Firstly students *vastly* overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS.

So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3.  
Only 2 students managed it.

Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 *might* have even managed to get 3 or more marks.

*So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination.* The mean bonus score was 1.27.

So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally.

That is the data for you.

### Also noteworthy

Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future.

None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks?

Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are *not* widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement!

**Bonuses are not a right.** They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life.

However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms:

> Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team.

[@carlton](/u/carlton)

Could you explain why so few students got good bonus marks? What was the criteria by which they were given?

---

The rubric is challenging and requires some level of collaboration with others. Thats why the bonus marks are low. Also the there is minimum requirement for even being eligible for it, i.e. you must complete GA7 and give 3 peer reviews before you can even be considered for bonus eligibility.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir and [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

Sir, As per your instructions, I had reached out to my peers well in advance; however, only 3 out of 8 responded. While 2–3 of the worksheets were publicly accessible, many remained private despite the ample time provided. This raises the possibility that the individual assigned to grade those particular sheets—aside from myself—may also not have had access, potentially affecting the overall grading accuracy.

Additionally, I noticed that some worksheets were largely incomplete or just a single sheet was provided, and there is a chance that a few participants may have copy-pasted their own values because the if the sheet were provide and access wasn’t given, the probability of the correct values being there was really high, which could further influence the evaluations. Admittedly there were quite a lot of empty sheets too which I gave zero as deserved but this might not have been the case with other evaluators.

Given these factors, I wanted to kindly request clarification on how these were handled. Was there a specific threshold required to qualify for the bonus, and how are such inconsistencies accounted  
Sir, some of us(including me) have submitted all 7 GAs and despite the end term we approached peers and completed all 8 reviews even when we had already got 90-110 in first four with average being 100 so I hope we could be graded fairly and appropriately for our efforts.

---

I am frankly surprised by this outcome. I don’t see how there could have been large variances in scores different evaluators would have given to a student.

I hope the data is not being skewed because of the total number of evaluations being low, or because of differing perceptions about how a student needs to be scored, or any other reason.

Thank you for raising a proper point about the fairness of the issue. The course’s rules seems to be changed on a whim, which is pretty unfair to those of us who completed the first 6 assignments properly. If anything, why not inform the +5 bonus before declaring the GA-7. “Rewarding diligence” is a vague point as completing 6 out of 7 assignments requires a decent commitment to the course. Getting rewarded for completing all 7 assignments is something absolutely commendable, without a doubt but getting a +5 on the basis of simply GA-7 is vague because it doesn’t guarantee the commitment towards the other 6 assignments. A person who has completed 6 assignments, skipping GA 7 is less diligent than someone who completed 4 assignments including GA7 is the summary I am gathering : )  
Please correct me if I am wrong
