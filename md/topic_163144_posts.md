# way-of-conduction-of-exam

My doubt is that “Will there be any coding level questions in the ROE and the weekly graded assignments?”

In ROE , usually you have to find the answers of the questions by solving them using codes and tools explained in the course .

For example you have a large pdf file of some patients and their disease and you are said to find number patients having some XYZ disease in that pdf . Now you can get this answer by using parsing tools and few lines of codes and after getting the results you can write that answer back in the portal .

Same goes for assignments , they will be more like minor project works.
