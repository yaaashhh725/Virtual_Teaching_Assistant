# best-practices-for-virtual-environments-and-dependency-management-in-python

Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.

Additionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?

That said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.

Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:

1. **Isolation** – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.
2. **Reproducibility** – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.
3. **Portability** – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.

1. **Installing with pip individually (pip install package-name)**

• Good for quick experimentation and testing.

• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.

2. **Using requirements.txt**

• Best for **reproducibility** and **collaboration** since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.

**Specifying Versions in requirements.txt**

• If you **don’t specify a version**, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.

• If you **do specify a version (package==1.2.3)**, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.

**Handling Version Conflicts**

• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.

• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:

• Using **greater than/less than constraints**: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).

• Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.

**Best Practices Summary**

* Always use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).
* Use a **requirements.txt** file for reproducibility.
* Pin versions cautiously—avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.
* Periodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.

Kind regards

For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it’s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.

Whereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.

> For project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement
