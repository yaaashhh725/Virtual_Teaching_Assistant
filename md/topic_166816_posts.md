[@24ds3000061](/u/24ds3000061) [@22f2001532](/u/22f2001532)

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.

GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur-Sultan as their city.

Kind regards

You got 80 in ga4. And the bonus makes it to 90.

Thats what we have on our system.

Kindly post a screenshot of your dashboard if 90 is not showing for GA4

Dont worry we have your correct scores. We have done spot checks to make sure of the data consistency. We are having some technical difficulties with getting the evaluations which are on the TDS server to the Portal Operations team. Kindly bear with us while we work out the problem.  
(Its a data cleaning and packaging issue - a typical TDS problem ![:rofl:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/rofl.png?v=12 ":rofl:"))

I have completed and checked and even saved the assignment for GA2 and GA3, however it says that I was absent for both GA2 and GA3.

Please check my assignment and ensure that it has been corrected, since I have checked the website and I had submitted.

I have checked the backend server. The actual score is 85 in Module 1.

Ignore seek portal, because scores are evaluated externally on our server. Those scores on seek portal are just from the placeholder question that asked whether you saw GA1 and attempted it. It has no bearing on your actual marks.

The actual score will be in the dashboard soon.

Kind regards.

Sorry for the late upload but as you can see in the screenshot i had submitted answers for TDS Week 2 graded assignment but it shows 0 both here and in current courses tab.  
I did reload the recent tab before uploading and for tds ga submission i submit and keep the tab open until the timer runs out.

[@shubham6](/u/shubham6) I have checked the backend server. It does show your score as 8 for GA2, so we have the correct score for you.

Can you send me a screenshot of your dashboard (where your course cards are) thanks.

Kind regards
