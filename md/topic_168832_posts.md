The image is a screenshot of a programming interface, likely for an exam or coding challenge. It has several windows and panes:
\* \*\*Left Pane:\*\* Contains a list of tasks. The active task is about creating a FastAPI proxy server.
\* \*\*Right Pane:\*\* Shows the "Thunder Client" application, commonly used for testing APIs. It displays the result of a GET request, including the status (200 OK), size, and time.

10. Calculate correlation (1 mark)

Write a FastAPI proxy server that serves the data from the given URL but also adds a CORS header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: \* to the response.

Note: Keep your server running for the duration of the exam.
What is your FastAPI Proxy URL endpoint?

Your answer is absolutely correct [@23f2000573](/u/23f2000573)  
But the problem is you had to submit the answer rounded off to 3 decimal places. A decimal more or less would result in a wrong answer.

Hello Sir"s, [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I was able to successfully attempt only 5 questions within the time limit. But due to internet issues, I could not submit exactly at 1:45pm.  
My last submission was at 1:47pm. But if there was a auto save then you could already check my answers were in the portal.

I request you to please consider submission delays of 2-3 mins as this was due a technical glitches. And we too are switching tabs and running in vscode

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I tried submitting my exam at 3:14 AM EST, but my browser reloaded unexpectedly. I ended up re-entering my answers and submitted at 3:15:46 AM. I had completed eight questions (8 marks) well before the time, but got stuck on the last two.  
image description: The image shows a webpage interface. There's a logout button at the top and below that, a section titled "Recent saves". It displays two entries, both indicating a score of 8 with timestamps for when the saves occurred. The background is dark green.

Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) / [@Saransh\_Saini](/u/saransh_saini)

I am Gudivada Abiram(21f3002158). In my today’s ROE exam I forgot to click the save button. My score initially was 6/10. I was tackling another question and by that time the timer went off. I can even send my answers if required.  
I should have submitted more frequently, but I was busy solving the other questions for extra marks.  
Could you please consider my request?  
Thank you.

Hi [@21f3002158](/u/21f3002158)

I looked for your result in backend, seems like you didn’t click to submit button throughout the exam.

Since roe exam portal was similar to GA’s where you need to save answers using save button, after saving only your answers get evaluated and you get answers.

There is no way other than pressing save button, we can’t do any help with this.

Kind regards

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir, I got disconnected at around 1:35 due to a network glitch and had to restart my uv server as well collab which wasted around 5 min and my score was around 7 and further I ran multiple scripts which I had already saved as code snippets as part of GA for question 4 on vs code and Collab and finally got the answer but I exceeded the time limit since the submission I made was at 1:47:28 which was 9…so I request to please consider that  
Overall the ROE was a great experience and I wholly enjoyed the process

When I clicked the save button, it took an unusually long time to respond and eventually showed an error. There was no network issue, as other applications were working fine. However, the moment I clicked “Save,” all websites stopped loading, and my browser became unresponsive. I’m not sure what caused this problem, but I will share a screenshot to help diagnose the issue.

There is an input field where the answer should be entered. The interface shows a "Checking..." message and provides instructions to use Python, Excel, or JavaScript, and to round the answer to 3 decimal places. An error message "Error!

Join Discourse (IITM students only). Techical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only)." There is a speech bubble icon on the left of the text.
image text: Have questions? Join Discourse (IITM students only).
Techical issues? OPTIONAL: Join Google Meet (IITM students only).

Even on discourse we were continuously looking for new posts during ROE, you created discourse post at 2:3 PM which was after deadline so we can’t help with it.

I have attempted all the questions in the ROE and solved few of the questions but i forgot to save the submission. At that time, I did not realize that I have not even saved once during the time. After realizing that i have not saved it in the evening, I have used the console to disable the save and saved my answers. Is it possible to validate it? I don’t have any submissions before 1:45pm. I realize that it is my mistake for not being careful about it but i request sir to be lenient about it as the project 1 was also difficult and i have my exams tomorrow.

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal)

Until not clicked on save button answers get’s checked at frontend side only. There is no way we can validate it after deadline.

I trust you would have solved few questions and also would have checked before deadline but clicking on save button was must to get submission evaluated.

Kind regards

i have not saved even once during the deadline but i have submitted/saved by hacking it in the evening when i realised that i have not saved it, i am asking you to consider that as i really don’t have any saves before deadline which will result me 0 marks, my request is to accept post deadline save by being lenient about it else i will get 0 marks. I will be satisfied even if you consider my 2nd save rather than latest save. (1st save was a sample test to check if possible, so it was 0 marks but the 2nd save is under 1-2 min which may prove that i have done all that questions before)

Hi [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal)

After deadline we gave allowance for 2 minutes considering network issues students might have faced, so till 1:47:00 all submissions will be considered valid, after that we won’t take any submissions.

Following are your submissions all of them were after deadline

Hello sir, [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj)  
Do you mean you will not consider them for evaluation then?

yes, as you can see my first save is at 7:25 which was a trial check if post submission is working or not but you can see that the 2nd and 3rd are saved in approx 1 minute but i got 8 corrects which proves that i have done it before only. the latest save got 9 marks as i forgot to run the fastapi server for 1st mark which resulted me 3 more minutes. So, I request sir to consider any one of the saves except the first save

Sorry [@Jayeshbansal](/u/jayeshbansal) All your submissions were around 7 hours after 1:47:00 Pm, that’s why we won’t consider them for evaluation.

Kind regards

Hi [@23f3002537](/u/23f3002537)  
The problem is that, here you are sending headers unnecessary and overwriting the original headers. Moreover you were returning the text of the response instead of the json. Here is the revised version.

```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
import httpx
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware to handle preflight OPTIONS requests
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

@app.get("/api")
async def proxy(url: str, request: Request):
    headers = {key: value for key, value in request.headers.items() if key.lower() != "host"}
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(url)
            return response.json()
    except httpx.RequestError as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Request failed: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

```

Hello [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,

Will it be possible to consider only the minutes. I also cannot control the technical delays. I raised the point as fast as possible and I also joined the technical GMEET and exited when a different person raised the same question.

I would dearly propose to consider still 1:47. But if it’s 1:48 you can ofcourse not consider it. But the “seconds” is something unrealistic.

Please re consider this request sir.

I checked your submission, its at 1:47:30 PM. We are going to give a grace period of 2 minutes past 1:45 PM. Given that you submitted 30 seconds past 1:47, we won’t be able to consider it.  
Regards

Please reconsider this decision. In the heat of the moment, I failed to save. In my mind, I was sure that I had saved it. There is one other student with the same problem ( saved a few seconds after 1:47).

Since I did only one save, I would get zero marks if the score is not considered.

I didn’t submit any new answer after 1:45 pm.

Please reconsider if possible.
