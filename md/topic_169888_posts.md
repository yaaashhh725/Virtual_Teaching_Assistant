Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  
I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7.1. In task 4.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?  
image description: The image is a screenshot of a table, most likely from a spreadsheet program like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. The table contains data related to "PPI industry data" for pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing. The table has multiple rows, and each row has data in multiple columns. The first row displays information about Anticoagulants, hemostatics, and digitalis preparations. The second part displays information about Calcium channel blockers.

@[Jivraj](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/u/Jivraj)

In the GA 7.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are  
![{7059D6FF-DF75-4B21-999A-29D23A297A90}](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a6fdec02b5239ef02c5198e250c8a2d6eb007b82.png)

but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”

Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  
Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.

Hi Tanya,

Both you responses have been recorded. So it has not been deleted. Its just the way google forms works, it does not reload your previous responses.

Kind regards

The question asked for top 5 countries. So that would be the approach for this question, not aggregated economic groups.

Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  
I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.

Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?  
image description: The image is a screenshot of a Gmail inbox. The top of the screen has a search bar with "peer review" entered. The inbox displays a list of emails, with subjects related to "TDS Jan 25" and peer evaluations. Two of the emails have the same file attachment, highlighted in pink: "23f3003944.html". The right corner shows the user's profile picture with "IIT Madras".

Sir,  
In case we are not provided access to view their respective sheets, we would have no option but to either leave the column blank or mark it as 0. However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%.

In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus?

Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted. This would ensure consistency across all submissions and avoid discrepancies arising from random or subjective entries, which seems to be happening currently.

If you are not provided access, contact the peer. Their email is there in the html file. It’s in the peers interest **and** yours. That’s an important aspect of GA7, it’s to get people to work together and collaborate.  
Peer reviews like the real world is going to be messy. The way to reduce the messiness is to communicate with one another.
