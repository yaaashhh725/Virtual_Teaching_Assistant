# ga4-bonus-marks

Sir,  
I havenâ€™t received bonus marks in ga4 as, i posted queries in discourse regarding ga4. I have scored 8 marks in ga4, but after bonus marks it should be 9, but in dashboard it is showing only 80 marks.  
Kindly, update my marks in dashboard.

Hi [@Sakshi6479](/u/sakshi6479),

You have not followed the instruction in GA4 for the bonus mark.

image text: Bonus marks for posting on Discourse
To encourage discussions, IITM BS students who reply to the discussion on GA4 - Data Sourcing - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025]\_ with a relevant question or reply will get 1 bonus mark on this graded assignment.

We were given the list by Anand for all those that followed this instruction.

That is why you have not received the bonus mark for GA4.

Kind regards
