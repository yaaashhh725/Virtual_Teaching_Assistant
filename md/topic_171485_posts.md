# project-1-discrepancy-regarding-mit-license

Sir,

The License file is present in the github repository however i received a mail that said that it was absent.  
Here's a description of the image:
\*\*Image Description:\*\*
The image is a screenshot of a GitHub repository page. It displays the file structure and commit history of a project named "tds\_project-1". The interface is dark-themed. The main branch is selected. There are several files listed: `\_pycache\_`, `venv`, `Dockerfile`, `LICENSE`, `MIT LICENSE`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `test.txt`. Each file has a corresponding description of the latest commit (e.g., "Final Submission", "First submission", "Create LICENSE", "Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE"), and the time since the last commit (e.g., "2 months ago", "now").
\*\*image text:\*\*

image description: The image is a text-based document which is most likely a status report for a project. The document starts by indicating that failing to meet a minimum requirement means the submission will not be evaluated. This is followed by the evaluations for Project 1 Prerequisites which indicates the status of the evaluation of four requirements (Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS, Is Github repo present AND public: PASS, Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS, Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL). The document concludes by indicating "Prerequisites: FAIL", and "Project 1 Score: 0".
image text: If you fail to meet this minimum requirement your submission will not get evaluated.
These are your Project 1 Prerequisite evaluations:
Is Docker image present in dockerhub AND is public: PASS
Is Github repo present AND public: PASS
Is Dockerfile present in root of github repo: PASS
Is MIT license present at root of github repo: FAIL
Prerequisites: FAIL
Project 1 Score: 0

Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Can you please look into it. Thankyou!

Hi [@22f3000585](/u/22f3000585)

Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).

[Adding a license to a repository - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)

Kind regards

Here's a description of the image:
\*\*Image Description:\*\*
The image is a text-based notification stating that a submission has failed. It highlights the reasons for failure: missing repository, "MIT" in the license, and a missing Dockerfile.
\*\*image text:\*\*
We see that your submission https://github.com/22f3000585/tds\_project-1.git has a result of FAIL due to the below reasons:
No such repo; No "MIT" in LICENSE;No Dockerfile
  
Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  
Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!

Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.  
image description : The image contains instructions for a submission. The first line states "No "MIT" in LICENSE; No Dockerfile". The second line directs the user to ensure that their submission passes the above checklist for it to be considered for scoring. The third line notes that only the latest submission will be considered.
image text: No "MIT" in LICENSE;No Dockerfile
Please ensure that your submission passes the above checklist for it to be even considered for scoring.
Note: We've only considered your latest submissions, as we permitted students to submit more than once.

[@24ds2000125](/u/24ds2000125) [@22f3000585](/u/22f3000585)

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.

But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.

Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.  
Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.

These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.

Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.

We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.

I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.

Kindest regards

Sir,  
Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.  
I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).  
I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.  
I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.  
Thankyou!

One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.

Sir, I received the mail today -  
image description: The image shows a list of prerequisites checks and their results. The text includes the following checks: Docker repo exists, Github repo exists, presence of license file, and presence of a Dockerfile.
image text: Pre-requisites check: (1 for pass, 0 for fail)
Docker repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo exists and is public (should have a timestamp before 18th of Feb): 1
Github repo check - LICENSE or LICENSE.md file exists (MIT License): 0
Gihub repo check - Dockerfile exists: 1
  
Sir, I had already added the LICENSE and changed it to’MIT LICENSE’ due to this reason before the deadline itself.  
image description: The image is a screenshot of a text-based message. It states that a submission with a link to a GitHub repository has a result of FAIL. The message lists the reasons for the failure, which include the absence of a repository, "MIT" in the LICENSE, and a Dockerfile.
image text: We see that your submission https://github.com/22f3000585/tds\_project-1.git has a result of FAIL due to the below reasons:
No such repo; No "MIT" In LICENSE NO Dockerfile
  
Sir,the rest of my prerequistes are working well.Can you please check as due to this my project has also not been evaluated.The MIT LICENSE file was already present in the github repo as I submitted my project’s github repo in the google form that was provided.  
image description: The image displays a file directory with various files and folders. The listed folders are \_pycache\_, and venv, with files like Dockerfile, LICENSE, MIT LICENSE, app.py, requirements.txt, and test.txt. The context suggests a version control system, as there are timestamps indicating when the file was last updated and the number of commits. The image also indicates a recent action 'Create LICENSE' done 5 days ago.
image text: 22f3000585 Create LICENSE c61a6ef. 5 days ago 6 Commits
\_pycache\_ Final Submission 2 months ago
venv First submission 2 months ago
Dockerfile First submission 2 months ago
LICENSE Create LICENSE 5 days ago
MIT LICENSE Rename LICENSE to MIT LICENSE 2 months ago
app.py Final Submission 2 months ago
requirements.txt First submission 2 months ago
test.txt First submission 2 months ago
  
Sir can you please check.  
Thankyou
