**“Students are allowed to take help from their pets in completing assignments.”**  
So I did. ![:man_tipping_hand:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/man_tipping_hand.png?v=14 ":man_tipping_hand:")

### :dog_face::graduation_cap: *Confession: My Labrador Did All My Assignments* :books::laptop:

Yes, I got **great marks** in Assignments, ROEs, and Project 1.  
But let’s be real…

It was **my Labrador** who did the actual work ![:service_dog:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/service_dog.png?v=14 ":service_dog:")![:brain:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/brain.png?v=14 ":brain:")

While I was snoozing through deadlines, he was:

* Solving **deployment issues** faster than my dev server boots
* Writing **function calling code** like a true GPT whisperer
* Fixing **LLM bugs** that I didn’t even understand

Meanwhile, I was just vibing in my blanket.  
He growled at broken APIs.  
I took the credit. ![:nail_polish:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/nail_polish.png?v=14 ":nail_polish:")

> “Thank you all for an awesome semester!  
> I learned more than some juniors. From containerization to prompt tuning.  
> But I am **personally offended** by one thing…”

> “How dare you give **bonus marks on Week 7**?  
> I skipped it — just like many — because we were told *only best 4 of 7 would count*.  
> I demand justice. And a belly rub.”

### :paw_prints: Moral of the story:

Let your pets help with your coursework.  
You get the grade. They get the rage.
