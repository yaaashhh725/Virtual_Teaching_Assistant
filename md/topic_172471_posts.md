# what-to-do-if-peer-has-not-allowed-access-and-the-deadline-is-over-for-peer-review-in-project-2

I had been accidentally given a duplicate peer and assigned a new peer on 10th April with the evaluation deadline being 11th April 11:59 PM. I had asked for access to the Google Sheet for question 1 however I have not been given any access and the deadline is up. What to do?

[@SohamHaldar](/u/sohamhaldar) [@21f3000745](/u/21f3000745) We had sent out an email with an extra non - duplicate peer and extended the deadline by a day to accommodate reviewing the extra peer. Please check your email with the subject.

Yes sir, but therein lies the problem, this extra peer (atleast for me) did not give me access to his Google Sheets and now the deadline is over and I could not submit a blank Google form.
