Some scores will be pushed to dashboard on or after 14th, they are part of an update score batch. Yours is likely waiting to be pushed. We will give a discrepancy form after endterm. If your score is not showing on dashboard, fill that and operations will have a look. From our side we have a score for you of 55 for Project 1.
